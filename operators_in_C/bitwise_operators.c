    //5- bitwise operators
        {&, |, ~, <<, >>, ^}
        â€¢ &: bitwise AND
            - binary operator takes two numbers
            - result is 1 when both bits are 1
        â€¢ |: bitwise OR
            - binary operator takes two numbers
            - result is 0 when both bits are 0
        â€¢ ~: bitwise NOT
            - unary operator complement each bit one by one
            - result is 0 when bit is 1 and 1 when bit is 0
        â€¢ <<: bitwise LEFT SHIFT
            - binary operator
            - first operand << second operand
                first operand: whose bits get right shifted
                second operand: number of places to shift the bits
            -when bits are shifted left then
                trailing positions filled with zeros
            - is equivalent to multiplication by (2 power right operand)
        â€¢ >>: bitwise RIGHT SHIFT
            - binary operator
            - first operand << second operand
                first operand: whose bits get right shifted
                second operand: number of places to shift the bits
            - when bits are shifted left then
                leading positions filled with zeros
            - is equivalent to division by (2 power right operand)
        â€¢ ^: bitwise XOR
            - binary operator
            - OR or Inclusive OR they are same
            - X-OR or Exclusive OR they are same
                when both operands are 1 then output is 0
                when one operand is 0 then the output is 1
