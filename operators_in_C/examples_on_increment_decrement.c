    # first what is the meaning of lexical analysis???
        - lexical analysis is the first phase in the compilation process
        - lexical analysis always matches the longest character sequence
        - lexical analyzer (scanner) scans the whole source program and
            when it finds the meaningful sequence of characters (lexemes)
            then it converts it into a "token"
        what is the meaning of token???
        example:- int-> <keyword, int> !!
            lexical analysis scan all this lexemes and generate a token
            for this lexemes which contain information
                like int this is a keyword

            â–º the summary: the lexical analysis phase is finding out
                the meaning behind each every character sequence
